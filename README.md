# Information Page

## The Community
The Aspie World Community is all about spreading awareness and gaining acceptance of the Autism community in a positive and welcoming manner. Here in The Aspie World we believe we’re all awesome in our own way and through knowledge and understanding we can make this world a more awesome place.
## The Discord
Our discord community is a safe place for aspies and neurotypicals alike to come together no matter where you are in the world to discuss ASD related commonalities, share special interests, participate in live voice chat sessions, and best of all, to make awesome new friends. Our volunteer Community Managers and Staff are available to answer any questions you have about navigating our many topic-specific channels. After verifying your age you will have access to our age specific channels as well.
An important channels to explore first would be our [#rules](https://discordapp.com/channels/466239080360050718/466308793949618187) channel. We are very protective of our members in this community so you may find that some of our rules are a bit different than other discord servers. We have the help of specially coded bots to reinforce some of our more notable rules. These bots detect the use of sensitive language and help redirect messages containing sensitive key words to the appropriate channel. Use of ALL CAPS and excessive emojis will also be detected by the bots. Links must always be approved by a Community Manager and the bots will temporarily mute any member who does not have permission to post a link of any kind, this also includes gifs. Members of staff will be alerted by the bots when an incident occurs.
When you’ve had a few minutes to look over our rules we recommend checking out the [#introductions](https://discordapp.com/channels/466239080360050718/468518379825790996) channel. Here you can read short bio’s written by other members in the community. If you’re comfortable enough to write your own you can do so at any time, we’d love to read a little bit about you! Feel free to explore the other channels and engage in friendly conversation with other members.
You can start a voice chat or join an active voice chat at any time in one of our Voice channels. When using the vc channels please be courteous and respectful to the other members. Please keep the topics friendly and age appropriate for all members in the channel. When speaking in a vc channel remember to use favorable language, we do not tolerate vulgarity or slandering of any kind.
TAW respects your privacy. If you wishing to discuss sensitive information with our Support Team and Staff members you can create a Ticket. A ticket is a private chat channel created by you and may only be accessed by you and members of our Support Team and Staff. You can request the removal or addition of another member to your ticket for any reason. No member is required to participate in ticket conversations, but it is crucial to remember that anything said within a ticket must remain in the ticket and not shared with outside sources. To create a ticket you can type -new in the [#bot-commands](https://discordapp.com/channels/466239080360050718/466310175742099456) channel. Your ticket will remain open as long as it is active. If your ticket has been inactive for 48 hours it will close automatically and you may open a new ticket if the need arises.
